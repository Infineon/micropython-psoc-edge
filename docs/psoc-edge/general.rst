General information about the PSOC™ Edge port
==============================================

The PSOC™ Edge is designed for next generation responsive compute and control applications, featuring hardware-assisted machine learning (ML) acceleration.
The PSOC™ Edge devices are based on high performance Arm® Cortex®-M55, including Helium™ DSP support paired with Arm® Ethos™-U55 and Cortex®-M33 paired Infineon’s ultra-low power NNLite neural network accelerator.

The PSOC™ Edge port supports boards powered by the `Infineon PSOC™ Edge family of microcontrollers <https://www.infineon.com/products/microcontroller/32-bit-psoc-arm-cortex/32-bit-psoc-edge-arm>`_ and currently supports the following MCUs:
