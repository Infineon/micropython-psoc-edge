Pins and GPIO
-------------

See :ref:`machine.Pin <machine.Pin>` for the complete Pin API reference.
This section focuses on the specific PSOC™ Edge port variations and particularities.

The constructor
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The controller pin naming follows the nomenclature ``P<port>_<pin>``, where:

 - ``<port>`` is a numeric identifier for the port (e.g., 0-21 for the PSOC™ Edge E84)
 - ``<pin>`` is the pin number within that port.

Use the respective board pinout diagram to find the available pins and their locations.

This is the ``id`` that needs to be passed to the constructor in one of the following formats:

 - As a **string label**, single or double quoted: ``'P<port>_<pin>'`` or ``"P<port>_<pin>"``
 - A **pre-instantiated object** ``Pin.cpu.<pin>`` or ``Pin.board.<pin>``.

::

    from machine import Pin

    p_in  = Pin('P0_0', Pin.IN)
    p_out = Pin("P7_0", Pin.OUT, value=False)

    p = Pin(Pin.cpu.P17_1, Pin.OPEN_DRAIN)


The pre-instantiated object can be used directly without calling the constructor.
Instead, you can use ``init()`` to configure it.

::

    from machine import Pin

    pin = Pin.cpu.P17_0
    pin.init(mode=Pin.IN)


.. tip::
    Use the REPL interface to discover the available user pins, using tab for completion:

    >>> Pin.cpu.P

In addition to the supported ``pull`` configuration values, ``PULL_UP_DOWN`` is also available in this port.

The ``drive`` parameter accepts up to 8 levels, which set the following drive strength for the pin:

 - ``DRIVE_0``: 1mA/2mA drive current (normal/high speed IO)
 - ``DRIVE_1``: 2mA/4mA drive current (normal/high speed IO)
 - ``DRIVE_2``: 3mA/6mA drive current (normal/high speed IO)
 - ``DRIVE_3``: 4mA/8mA drive current (normal/high speed IO)
 - ``DRIVE_4``: 5mA/10mA drive current (normal/high speed IO)
 - ``DRIVE_5``: 6mA/12mA drive current (normal/high speed IO)
 - ``DRIVE_6``: 7mA/14mA drive current (normal/high speed IO)
 - ``DRIVE_7``: 8mA/16mA drive current (normal/high speed IO)

For more information about drive strength, check the PSOC™ Edge `Datasheet <pse8x_consumer_datasheet_>`_ and `Architecture Reference Manual <pse8x_arch_ref_manual_>`_.

.. note::

    The following constructor arguments and/or configuration values are NOT supported in this port:

        - ``alt``: Alternate functionality is not supported.
        - ``mode``: ``Pin.ALT``, ``Pin.ALT_OPEN_DRAIN``, and ``Pin.ANALOG`` modes are not supported.

Methods
^^^^^^^

.. method:: Pin.irq(handler=None, trigger=(Pin.IRQ_FALLING | Pin.IRQ_RISING), priority=7)

The following parameters have port-specific behavior:

    - ``priority``: Priority values range from 7 (lowest) to 0 (highest). Default is 7.

      .. note::

          All pins on the same port share the same interrupt line. Therefore, only one priority can be set for all pins on the same port. 
          If multiple pins configure interrupts for the same port, the highest priority will be used.
          If only one pin is configured for an interrupt, its priority can be reconfigured to any value.

.. note::

    The following ``irq()`` features are not supported in this port:

        - ``trigger``: The ``Pin.IRQ_LOW_LEVEL`` and ``Pin.IRQ_HIGH_LEVEL`` triggers are not supported.
        - ``wake``: The wake parameter is currently not supported.
        - ``hard``: This parameter is ignored. It can be passed but currently has no effect.

.. note::

    **None** of the non-core methods from the Pin API are currently implemented for this port.


Hardware I2C bus
----------------

See :ref:`machine.I2C <machine.I2C>` and :ref:`machine.I2CTarget <machine.I2CTarget>` for the complete I2C API reference.

Hardware I2C is available on the PSOC™ Edge E84 using the SCB (Serial Communication Block)
peripheral. The port supports both controller (master) and target (slave) modes.

.. note::

    External pull-up resistors (typically 4.7kΩ) are required on both SCL and SDA lines.
    Only one I2C instance (controller or target) can be active at a time, as both modes
    share the same SCB peripheral.

    The pins you specify must support I2C functionality (For now, only P17_0 and P17_1 are supported).

Controller mode (Master)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Use the ``I2C`` class for controller (master) operations::

    from machine import I2C

    # Create I2C - scl and sda pins are required
    i2c = I2C(scl='P17_0', sda='P17_1', freq=400000)
    
    # With custom timeout (default is 50000us = 50ms)
    i2c = I2C(scl='P17_0', sda='P17_1', freq=100000, timeout=100000)  # 100ms timeout
    
    # You can use any pins that support I2C alternate function
    # For KIT_PSE84_AI, the exposed I2C pins are P17_0 (SCL) and P17_1 (SDA)

Constructor arguments:

    - ``id``: I2C bus number (currently only 0 is available).
      **This parameter is ignored**.
    - ``scl``: SCL pin (**required**). String 'P<port>_<pin>' or Pin object.
      Must support I2C SCL alternate function.
    - ``sda``: SDA pin (**required**). String 'P<port>_<pin>' or Pin object.
      Must support I2C SDA alternate function.
    - ``freq``: I2C clock frequency in Hz. Supported: 100000 (100kHz) or
      400000 (400kHz). Default is 400000.
    - ``timeout``: Transfer timeout in microseconds. Must be > 0.
      Default is 50000 (50ms).

Target mode (Slave)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The I2CTarget implementation on PSoC Edge has the following port-specific details:

**Pin configuration:**
    - ``scl`` and ``sda`` pins are **required** parameters
    - Pins must support I2C alternate function
    - For KIT_PSE84_AI, P17_0 (SCL) P17_1 (SDA) are the only supported pins for I2C target mode.

**Memory addressing:**
    - ``mem_addrsize``: Only 0 is supported (no memory addressing)
    - EEPROM-like addressing (8/16/24/32 bit) is not yet implemented

**Supported IRQ triggers:**

Only transaction-level events are supported (soft IRQ only):

    - ``I2CTarget.IRQ_END_READ``: Triggered when master completes reading from slave
    - ``I2CTarget.IRQ_END_WRITE``: Triggered when master completes writing to slave
